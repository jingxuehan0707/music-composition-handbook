## Extended Dominant Series

A series of **three or more** dominant chords that start on a **strong** harmonic stress point, and resolve, one to the next, by descending perfect-5th root motion.

It is a backward extension of the V7/V - V - I progression. For example, the progression below is an extended dominant series that resolves to the tonic chord Cmaj7.

F#7 - B7 - E7 - A7 - D7 - G7 - Cmaj7

The chord scale is Mixolydian, hence we can use 9, 13 as tension.

> 1, T9, 3, S4, 5, T13, b7, 1

In addition, the extended dominant series can be used to:
- Resolve to different diatonic chords
- Indefinite Ending

## Deceptive Resolution of Secondary Dominant

There are three types of deceptive resolutions of secondary dominants:

- Resolve perfect-5th down to a different chord quality.
- Resolve up by step to a diatonic chord.
- Resolve down by half step to a triad, maj7, or 7th chord.
