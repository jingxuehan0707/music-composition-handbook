## Extended Dominant Series

A series of **three or more** dominant chords that start on a **strong** harmonic stress point, and resolve, one to the next, by descending perfect-5th root motion.

It is a backward extension of the V7/V - V - I progression. For example, the progression below is an extended dominant series that resolves to the tonic chord Cmaj7.

F#7 - B7 - E7 - A7 - D7 - G7 - Cmaj7

The chord scale is Mixolydian, hence we can use 9, 13 as tension.

> 1, T9, 3, S4, 5, T13, b7, 1

In addition, the extended dominant series can be used to:
- Resolve to different diatonic chords
- Indefinite Ending

## Deceptive Resolution of Secondary Dominant

There are three types of deceptive resolutions of secondary dominants:

- Resolve perfect-5th down to a different chord quality.
- Resolve up by step to a diatonic chord.
- Resolve down by half step to a triad, maj7, or 7th chord.

## Substitute Dominants

In major-key harmony, substitute dominants (SubV) is the substitution of the dominant chord V7. SubV is the diminished 5th degree above the V7. In the key of C, the SubV of G7 is Db7.

V7 and SubV share the same tritone. Let's review the G7 and its SubV Db7.

- G7: G, B, D, F. B, F form a tritone.
- Db7: Db, F, Ab, Cb. F, Cb form a tritone.

The 3rd of G7 is the 7th of Db7. The 7th of G7 is the 3rd of Db7.

### Usage of SubV

We can use SubV to resolve to the tonic chord.

Similarly, we can also use SubV to replace secondary dominants.

| Secondary Dominant | Substitute Dominant | Interpolated? |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| V7/II              | SubV/II             | No            |
| V7/III             | SubV/III            | Yes           |
| V7/IV              | SubV/IV             | No            |
| V7/V               | SubV/V              | No            |
| V7/VI              | SubV/VI             | Yes           |

| N/A                | E7<br>V7/VI     | A-7          |

### Chord Scale of SubV

Start with V7, Mixolydian scale

> 1, T9, 3, S4, 5, T13, b7, 1

Adding b9, b13, #9, and lowering the 5th, we get the altered dominant scale

> 1, Tb9, T#9, 3, b5, Tb13, b7, 1

Reorder the scale from b5, the root of the substitute dominant, we get the Lydian b7 scale.

> 1, T9, 3, T#11, 5, T13, b7, 1

In addition, for substitute dominants that resolve to a target chord that has a major 3rd (i.e. I, IV, and V7), we can use Lydian b7 (#9).

> 1, T#9, 3, T#11, 5, T13, b7, 1

### Extended Dominants Series Using Extended SubVs

We use Gershwin's tune "I Got Rhythm" as an example. The original rhythm changes bridge uses an extended dominant series.

There are three ways to add extended SubVs:

**Replace Dominants with SubV**

**Interpolate SubVs**

**Interpolate Related II**

## Augmented 6th Chords

### Neapolitan 6th Chord

It is simply a major triad built on the lowered second degree of a minor or major scale.

It is commonly used in first inversion. The common progressions are as follows.

* Db/F - G7 - C-
* Db/F - C-/G - G7 - C-

### Italian Augmented 6th Chord

The Italian 6th (It+6) is derived from the IV chord in first inversion.

In C major, follow this procedure to derive the Italian Augmented 6th Chord:
* Identify the first inversion of IV, F/A
* Descend the bass a minor 2nd, from A to Ab
* Ascend the root a half step, from F to F#
* We have the new chord that consists of Ab, C, F#.

### German Augmented 6th Chord

The German augmented 6th (Ger+6) chord in the minor key finds its start point in the IV-7 chord in first inversion.
> Formula: raise the root.

The German augmented 6th (Ger+6) chord in the major key finds its start point in the II-7 chord in second inversion.
> Formula: Lower the bass, and raise the root.

### French Augmented 6th Chord

The French 6th (Fr+6) begins with the II-7 chord in second inversion.

> Formula: Lower the bass, and raise the root.

Tchaikovsky introduced the augmented 6th chord as a dominant 7th chord in 2nd inversion with a lowered bass note.

The result is a French augmented 6th chord that can conceivably function as a colorful alternative to the primary dominant as well as the other four secondary dominants.

> Formula: Lower the bass.

## Diminished 7th Chord

This chord has a completely symmetrical structure. It is constructed of 3rds, but it is the only 7th chord in which all of the 3rds are of the same size—minor 3rds.

The diminished 7th chord can be used in three ways:
* Secondary Dominant Function: The Ascending Diminished Seventh
* Descending Chromatic Passing Approach Chord: Passing Diminished
* Embellishing Chords: Auxiliary Diminished 7th Chords

When used as a secondary dominant function, the chord has a root which is a half step above the target chord.

When used as a passing chord, the most common of these is bIII°7. Less common is bVI°7 which precedes the related II of the V7/IV.

When used as an embellishing chord, these chords are often found in embellishments of the Imaj and V7 chords in popular songs.

## Non-Chord Tone and Approach Tone

In contemporary music, there are five types of approach tones:

* Passing tone (PT)
* Neighbor tone (NT)
* Unprepared approach (UA)
* Indirect resolution (IR)
* Double chromatic passing tone (DCPT)

We can harmonize the approach tones in four ways:

* Dominant approach
* Diminished approach
* Parallel approach
* Diatonic approach

## Polychords

- **Polychords** are voicings with tensions in the upper structure grouped as triads or 7th chords above the essential chord tones of the lower structure.
- **Harmonic avoid tones** are omitted from the voicing.
- The **lower structure** may be in close position or spread.
- The **upper structure tones** may be close-voiced, inverted, or spread as desired.
- The **perfect 5th** is often omitted but can be included if it does not interfere with tensions such as ♭13 or ♯11.
- The **upper and lower structures** should be separated by at least the interval of a third.
- **Polychord voicings** are expressed as an **upper structure chord symbol** over the **lower structure chord symbol**, separated by a horizontal line.

Memorize the formula below.

## Minor Key Summary

Harmony in the minor key can be drawn exclusively from one of three source scales:

- **Natural Minor or Aeolian**
- **Harmonic Minor**
- **Melodic Minor**

Within each scale, the functions belong to one of three groups:

- **Tonic**
- **Subdominant**
- **Dominant (Modal Cadence Chord Group)**

The chord scales for each function are drawn from the natural minor source, or in the case of those chords that contain scale degrees 6 or 7, from the melodic or harmonic minor source.

The three sources combine to create the **composite minor scale**. Within the composite minor scale:

- **Tonic options**: Chords built on **1, ♭3, and 6**.
- **Subdominant options**: Chords built on **2, 4, and ♭6**.
- **Dominant and modal cadence chord options**: Chords built on **5, ♭7, and 7**.

Understanding functional groupings allows the composer to create clear functional progressions while taking advantage of the shading that each variant offers.

### Natural Minor Harmony

| Function    | Chord Scale | Tensions            | Harmonic Avoid Notes |

### Harmonic Minor Harmony
All other functions derive their chord scales from the natural minor source.
| Function     | Chord Scale                                      | Tensions                  | Harmonic Avoid Notes   |

### Melodic Minor Harmony

V7 in the minor key is almost exclusively derived from the harmonic minor source.
